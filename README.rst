The official documentation for coala
====================================

This is the official documentation for coala, and it is online at https://docs.coala.io.
The coala repository can be found
`here <https://github.com/coala/coala>`__.

How to build
============

You should run this command before trying to build the documentation:

::

    pip3 install -r docs-requirements.txt

You can test the documentation locally through simply running

::

    make html

in the root directory. This generates ``_build/html/index.html`` that you can
view on your browser.

If you want to add new pages, you need to alter the index.rst file in the root
directory. Please read
http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/markup/toctree.html#toctree-directive for
an explanation of the syntax.
